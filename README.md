Add a tabindex value to comment_form submit button for WordPress

Altering the submit button has been proposed but not accepted yet (2 years now), see more here: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15015

The plugin uses JS to add tabindex to single post entries (posts and CPTs, no attachments and pages included) with a value of 5 (by default), might be edited in the JS file.
